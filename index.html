            <h3>Research Assistant || Full Stack Developer || JAVA Developer</h3>
            <p>Ever since I was a little kid, software development has been my passion. I still remember sitting in front of my computer while I was a school student, printing "Hello Asif" for the very first time. As I went through the BASIC tutorial, it was almost magic, being able to get the computer to do whatever I wanted, just by typing in these funny little symbols, limited only by my own imagination and ingenuity. Throughout middle and high school, I latched on to any ideas for projects I could get, moving from "Hello World" all the way to a simple First Person Shooter engine, with dozens of projects in between. I learned Java then C++, tearing through any books I could find on anything remotely related to software development. I was insatiable.

                This passion carried me through my education at Computer Science and Engineering. Here there were more resources available to me than I ever could have imagined as a kid. I studied new languages, algorithms, compilers, higher mathematics, all with pretty much the same fascination that drove me as a kid. And it was here that I learned truly how much there was yet to learn. 
                
                So, now, in industry, this passion remains with me. There's certainly yet more to learn, yet more problems to solve, and yet more to build. And for this, I am very grateful.
